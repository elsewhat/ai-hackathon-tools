# AzureOpenAI.Model.EmbeddingsCreateRequestInput
Input text to get embeddings for, encoded as a string. To get embeddings for multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of strings. Each input must not exceed 2048 tokens in length. Unless you are embedding code, we suggest replacing newlines (\\n) in your input with a single space, as we have observed inferior results when newlines are present.
